## Real Family Migration Stories from 2025–2026
- Software engineer (34) moved from Bay Area to Austin in Jan 2026: Saved **$41,200** in the first year alone.
- Nurse practitioner couple ($195k combined): Saved **$14,800** + significantly lower housing costs.

## The Break-Even Point
For households earning under $110k, the gap is smaller due to California’s higher standard deduction. However, above **$130k household income**, Texas wins decisively, and the advantage grows rapidly as income increases.

## Who Should Strongly Consider Moving to Texas in 2026?
- Tech workers and engineers
- High earners ($200k+)
- Families with children
- Anyone receiving large bonuses or stock compensation

## Bottom Line for 2026
If you earn over $130,000 and are even slightly open to relocating, the data strongly favors Texas (or Florida) over California. The savings are life-changing at higher income levels.

## Real Retiree Migration Stories 2025–2026
- Couple from Long Island (ages 68 & 71, $110k combined): Saved **$19,400** in the first year after moving to Naples.
- Widow from Buffalo ($75k pension + SS): Saved **$14,800** + much warmer weather and lower overall costs.

## Why Florida Wins for Almost Every Retiree in 2026
- Social Security is 100% exempt
- Pensions and IRA withdrawals are 100% exempt
- No estate or inheritance tax
- Homestead exemption caps property tax increases at 3% per year

## The One Rare Scenario Where New York Might Still Win
If your income is 100% from a New York government pension that is fully exempt in NY but would be partially taxable in Florida (very rare), staying might make sense. For 98% of retirees, Florida is the clear winner.

## Retiree Relocation Checklist for 2026
1. Run your exact numbers on both calculators above
2. Spend at least 30 days in Florida to start establishing domicile
3. Update Social Security and pension direct deposit addresses

## Real Washington Resident Stories 2025–2026
- Amazon engineer ($220k salary + $450k RSUs): Paid $14,000 capital gains tax in WA vs $0 in Nevada → moved and saved $14,000+
- Retiree couple with $95k pension: $0 state tax in WA (same as Florida)

## Washington 2026 Planning Checklist
1. Track capital gains carefully (7% kicks in fast above the threshold)
2. Consider deferring large stock sales or moving before big liquidity events
3. Use our calculator monthly to model RSU/option scenarios
4. Strong LLC protections still make it attractive for side businesses

Washington is excellent for pure W-2 earners and retirees, but anyone with significant capital gains or stock compensation should run the numbers against pure no-tax states like Texas or Florida.

1. Run your exact numbers on our **[state tax calculators](/)** for old and new state
2. Calculate total savings and payback period
3. Get job offer or remote work confirmation in writing

- Update voter registration in the new state
- Get new driver’s license within 30 days of arrival
- Change bank, credit cards, brokerage, and insurance addresses
- File a declaration of domicile if the new state requires it (Florida, Texas, etc.)

## Phase 3: Tax & Financial Setup
- Update your W-4 and estimated tax payments with your employer
- File your final return in the old state (many states offer moving credits)
- Notify Social Security, pensions, and 401(k) providers of your new address
- Update LLC or business filings if you own a company

## Phase 4: Post-Move (First 6 Months)
- Keep utility bills, lease agreement, and gym membership as proof of residency

|---------------------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| State + City Income Tax   | $52,300 (at $450k)| $0             | $52,300           |

## Why the Exodus Continues in 2026
- No meaningful tax relief passed in the last legislative session
- Sky-high property taxes in suburbs and NYC
- Crime, quality-of-life issues, and remote-work flexibility
- Better weather and zero income tax just a short flight away

## Real New Yorkers Who Left in 2025–2026
- Finance executive from Manhattan ($520k): Saved **$68,000** in the first year after moving to Florida
- Teacher couple from Long Island ($165k combined): Saved **$14,200** + much lower housing costs
- Small business owner from Brooklyn: Saved **$41,200** + lower commercial rent in Texas

## The Break-Even Point
For households under $110k, the gap is smaller. Above $150k, New York becomes extremely expensive very quickly. At $400k+, the annual penalty often exceeds $60,000.

## Action Checklist if You Still Live in New York
1. Run your exact numbers on our New York calculator
2. Compare to Florida, Texas, or Tennessee using the side-by-side feature
3. Start tracking days in a potential new state
4. Consult a CPA who specializes in New York exit planning

New York is still one of the most expensive states in America. Run your numbers above and see exactly how much you could be keeping by leaving.
